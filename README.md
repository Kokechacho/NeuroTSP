# NEST: Exploring the Neuromorphic Paradigm

This repository aims to teach and make the neuromorphic paradigm more accessible through practical examples and clear explanations, using **NEST** as the central tool. Through a series of Python notebooks, we document a personal journey in using this paradigm, which simulates neuronal behavior and is designed to tackle complex problems in a highly parallelized manner.

## What is NEST?

**NEST** is a simulation tool that allows you to model large and complex neural networks, particularly useful for computational neuroscience research. This software provides a flexible and efficient environment for studying the dynamics of biological and artificial neural networks. Through NEST, it is possible to perform simulations that mimic the behavior of neurons in the brain, using models that replicate the functioning of biological neural networks.

### How Does It Work?

NEST operates on an event-based approach, where interactions between neurons are modeled through **spikes**, rather than using fixed time steps or sequences. This enables a high level of parallelism in the simulations, as neurons are activated independently and asynchronously. The results are processed based on the spikes generated by each neuron in response to stimuli, simulating the actual behavior of neural systems.

### Advantages and Future Prospects

The use of event-based neural networks offers significant advantages over traditional programming paradigms. The ability to process multiple events simultaneously results in massive parallelism, which translates to greater efficiency and the ability to model systems of much higher complexity than in sequential approaches.

This paradigm is still in its early stages of development, meaning its level of abstraction is quite low. Currently, users must interact with neurons and connections at a very detailed level, which can be challenging. However, this approach presents a great opportunity for future innovation, as researchers work towards formulating **more developed languages** or libraries that facilitate programming within this paradigm, without needing to deal with neurons at such a low level.

As the field of neuromorphic computing evolves, the applications of **NEST** and similar systems will continue to grow in importance, not only in scientific research but also in innovative technological solutions.
